# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-R
Time series model with R

The project is about builing model to predict hourly energy load for the next day.

To capture the strong seasonality of the load data, we add lag variables, seasonality variables and trigonometric function variables. Considering the strong effect of temperature, the high and low temperature of each region is also a significant feature. 

The best model performance successfully reaches 3.22% MAPE for a three-year average.
